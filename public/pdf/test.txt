YOUR MONTHLY CHARGES
engin will charge you, monthly in advance, the Monthly
Service Fee applicable to your pricing plan. Calls included in your 
monthly plan will show $ 0 charge in the summary total column, if 
you exceed your included value a charge will be displayed.  We will 
prorate the Monthly Service Fee from the date you connect to your 
invoice issue date.
ACCOUNTING PERIOD
When you receive your account some charges may refer to a prior 
billing period. This is due to the timing of information processing. 
They are not duplicate charges.
HOW TO PAY YOUR BILL
Direct Debit
The total due of each bill is charged to your nominated credit card* 
or bank account on or the next working day from the due date on 
the front of this bill. This is an extremely convenient way to pay 
your account. With an automatic payment schedule you don't have 
to worry about remembering when your bill is due; we look after 
that for you. We accept Visa, MasterCard, American Express and 
Diners Club.
Bpay
Make a Bpay payment* via Internet or Phone banking each month 
on or before the bill due date
 
* Payments made using MasterCard or VisaCard will incur a 1% (inc 
GST) surcharge. Payments made using American Express or Diners 
Club will incur a 3% (inc. GST) surcharge. Payments made using 
Bpay incur a $ 1.00 (inc GST) surcharge. This reflects the cost of 
accepting these types of payments.  This fee will appear on the 
next account after the bill is paid.  There is no surcharge incurred 
when payments are made using a direct debit from your bank 
account.
BILL NON – PAYMENT
If payment is not received by the bill due date for any reason, we 
may restrict your service until your account is up to date. If you 
don't settle your account within an agreed period, usually 7 days 
from the bill due date, we may charge you a late payment fee or 
suspend your service. If this happens, any outstanding amounts 
you owe us will immediately fall due.
 
PREMIUM SERVICES
Premium Services which can include voting lines, ringtones and 
sports scores that operate via a:”19X” number incur higher then 
standard rates and can be either a one off or recurring cost 
depending on the type of premium service used. The third party 
content provider of the service determines these charges. You can 
restrict access to these services by contacting engin customer 
service to arrange a bar to be placed on all Premium SMS, this will 
not affect standard SMS services.
